###About

Rod Broker is a website where local fishing rod craftsman can sell their wares to a national and international audience. Builders can come in and make a page that lists what types of fishing rods they make and upload photos. Users can search builders by the data they enter, or generally search any builder. Users must log-in to see the Builder contact information.

Insight aggregates text and pushes it into the Watson PI API, this allows us to describe the personality of a group of people to describe the personality of groups talking about a trending twitter topic, user or string, or generally any text (1000 character - 25000 character) entered by the user. A switch at the bottom will allow you to select Twitter or other. The produced personalities are transformed into Myers Briggs types, and visualized via D3 tools. If a user logs in to our validated login weâ€™ll give the option of saving previous personality profiles, showing recent profiles and commenting on them.
